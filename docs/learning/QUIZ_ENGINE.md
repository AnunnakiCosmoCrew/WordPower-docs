---

## 1. What the Engine Does

Given a user, a quiz type, and a word source (e.g. *all my words* or *just my "business" domain*), the engine produces a **session** containing N persisted **questions**, each tied to one of the user's words.

The engine is responsible for:

- Picking which words become questions (==candidate pool==)
- Filtering out words that can't form a question of the requested type (==eligibility==)
- Building each question's prompt and (where applicable) options
- Selecting high-quality wrong answers (==distractors==)
- Storing the canonical correct answer for grading later

It is **not** responsible for scheduling reviews — that's the [[SPACED_REPETITION|SRS]] layer, which consumes the *outcome* of a quiz session.

## 2. Session Lifecycle

A quiz session goes through five operations, all enforced per-user (cross-user reads return 404):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[create] --> B[get]
    B --> C[submitAnswer]
    C --> C
    C --> D[finaliseResult]
    A --> E[list]
```

| Operation          | What it does                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **create**         | Pulls candidates from the user's notebook, dispatches to a generator, persists session + questions.                                                                     |
| **get**            | Loads a session with its questions in `ordinal` order.                                                                                                                  |
| **list**           | Paginated, newest-first feed of past sessions, decorated with score when available.                                                                                     |
| **submitAnswer**   | Records one answer; computes `isCorrect` against the stored canonical answer. **Idempotent up to first submission** — a second submit for the same question raises 409. |
| **finaliseResult** | Lazily creates the `QuizResult` row and stamps `finishedAt`. Idempotent — repeat calls return the same row.                                                             |

> [!info] Concurrency safety
> Both `submitAnswer` and `finaliseResult` defend against races: a UNIQUE constraint catches concurrent inserts and the loser is mapped back to the same outcome the pre-check would have produced. The public contract is *"answers are immutable"* and *"finalise is idempotent"* — full stop, not *"…except under contention"*.

## 3. Candidate Pool

Before any generator runs, the service pulls a pool of the user's `UserWord` rows:

| Rule | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Source** | The user's own collection only | All quiz types draw from the personal notebook |
| **Active only** | Soft-deleted (tombstoned) words excluded | Tombstones exist for sync, not for review |
| **Hard cap** | ==500 words== | Big enough for distractor headroom on a 50-question MCQ; small enough that the in-memory shuffle stays cheap |
| **Order** | Random within the active set (`ORDER BY random() LIMIT 500`) | Guarantees every word can be selected regardless of collection size — a 1000-word user must not have their oldest 500 words permanently locked out of every quiz |
| **Domain filter** | Optional, when `wordSourceType = DOMAIN_FILTER` | Lets the user quiz themselves on, e.g., just their "law" words |

> [!note] Source type validation
> `wordSourceType = DOMAIN_FILTER` requires a non-blank filter. `wordSourceType = ALL_WORDS` forbids one. Mismatches raise 400 — the API contract is strict so the FE can't accidentally request a filtered quiz with no filter.

## 4. Per-Type Generation Rules

Every generator follows the same shape:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Candidate pool] --> B[Filter eligible]
    B --> C[Shuffle]
    C --> D[Build question]
    D --> E[Assign ordinal]
    E --> F{More?}
    F -- yes --> D
    F -- no --> G[Return list]
```

The differences live in **what makes a word eligible** and **what the question payload looks like**.

> [!tip] Silent-skip principle
> If a candidate word can't form a valid question of the requested type, the generator **silently drops it**. The session ends up with fewer questions than requested rather than failing loudly. Only when **zero** questions can be formed does `create` raise 400 — an empty session is never persisted.

> [!note] Why type variety carries the depth load
> The four types aren't four flavours of the same test — each taps a different cognitive task: MCQ is **recognition** (match a word to one of four phrasings of its meaning), FITB is **contextual recognition** (does this word fit a sentence whose meaning was written by the user, not Free Dictionary), Flashcard is **bidirectional recall**, Spelling is **production with semantic scaffolding**. A user practising one word across all four modes meets its meaning in four different framings — no single type carries the depth load alone. This is why proposals to harden any one type (paraphrase rotation, semantic distractors, harder phrasings) sit in [[#10. Deferred / Future Work|§10]] as deferrals: the *system* defeats string-pairing through variety, so adding depth means adding a new framing or improving the mix, not stiffening an existing type.

### 4.1 Multiple Choice

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Eligible** | Word has a non-blank ==definition== |
| **Distractors** | 3, drawn from the same pool via [[#5. Distractor Selection\|DistractorService]] |
| **Skip condition** | Fewer than 3 distractors available — can't form a 4-option question |
| **Mode** (current) | `WORD_TO_DEFINITION` — stem is the word, options are definitions |
| **Mode** (alt) | `DEFINITION_TO_WORD` — stem is the definition, options are words |

The four option texts (1 correct + 3 distractors) are shuffled and labelled `A`–`D`. The ==correct option's id varies== across questions so a user can't pattern-match on position.

```json
{
  "mode":            "word_to_definition",
  "stem":            "ephemeral",
  "options": [
    {"id": "A", "text": "lasting forever"},
    {"id": "B", "text": "lasting a very short time"},
    {"id": "C", "text": "easily broken"},
    {"id": "D", "text": "deeply hidden"}
  ],
  "correctOptionId": "B"
}
```

### 4.2 Fill in the Blank

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Eligible** | Word has a cache row with `isEnrichable = true` AND ≥1 example sentence containing a whole-word match for the surface form |
| **Stem source** | First cached `exampleSentence` with a Unicode-aware whole-word match (`\b…\b` with `CASE_INSENSITIVE \| UNICODE_CASE \| UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS`) |
| **Blank** | Only the **first** occurrence is replaced with `___` — later occurrences stay as same-word hints |
| **Distractors** | 3 other user words (no example-sentence requirement on distractors — they only contribute their `word` to the bank) |
| **Skip condition** | No usable sentence, or fewer than 3 distractors |

> [!info] Performance — batch prefetch
> Dictionary cache rows for every candidate are loaded in a **single `findAllById`** at the start of `generate`. The earlier shape did one `findById` per target inside the loop, which scaled as one DB round-trip per candidate (up to 500). One indexed query up front beats 500 latency exposures even when most candidates get trimmed.

```json
{
  "stem":            "Her interest in chess proved ___ — within a month she'd moved on.",
  "options": [
    {"id": "A", "text": "ephemeral"},
    {"id": "B", "text": "perpetual"},
    {"id": "C", "text": "ancient"},
    {"id": "D", "text": "thorough"}
  ],
  "correctOptionId": "A"
}
```

### 4.3 Flashcard

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Eligible** | Word has a non-blank definition |
| **Direction** (default) | `BIDIRECTIONAL` — coin-flip per card between word→def and def→word |
| **Direction** (alt) | `WORD_TO_DEFINITION`, `DEFINITION_TO_WORD` |
| **Skip condition** | None beyond eligibility — every eligible word becomes a card |

Phonetic, part-of-speech, and example sentence are emitted on the payload **only if non-blank**, so the FE can render them without null-checks beyond *"is the field present?"*.

```json
{
  "direction":       "word_to_definition",
  "front":           "ephemeral",
  "back":            "lasting a very short time",
  "phonetic":        "/ɪˈfɛm(ə)rəl/",
  "partOfSpeech":    "adjective",
  "exampleSentence": "Her interest in chess proved ephemeral."
}
```

### 4.4 Spelling

> [!info] Status
> This section describes the **target design** being tracked under [issue #237](https://github.com/AnunnakiCosmoCrew/WordPower-app/issues/237). The current shipped implementation only emits `audioUrl` and `phonetic` and is being rebuilt to match what's documented here.

| Field                  | Rule                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Eligible**           | Non-blank surface form AND ≥1 pronunciation hint (`audioUrl` or `phonetic`) AND ≥1 semantic hint (definition or a usable example sentence)                                       |
| **Pronunciation hint** | At least one of `audioUrl` / `phonetic`; both included on the payload when present                                                                                                |
| **Definition**         | Emitted verbatim from `UserWord` when present                                                                                                                                     |
| **Blanked example**    | First cached example sentence with a whole-word match for the target, with that occurrence replaced by `___` (same Unicode regex as [[#4.2 Fill in the Blank\|FITB]])             |
| **Skip condition**     | No pronunciation hint, or no semantic hint (no definition AND no usable example)                                                                                                  |

> [!info] Cognitive-tier consequence
> Adding a definition + blanked example shifts spelling from pure **production** (generate from sound alone) toward **assisted production**. [[SPACED_REPETITION#10. How Quiz Types Feed Into SRS — Rating Inference Model]] needs a matching adjustment so a "spelling with help" correct answer doesn't push intervals as aggressively as the unscaffolded version would have.

> [!warning] Cheat prevention
> The canonical spelling lives only on `QuizQuestion.correctAnswer`, which `QuizMapper.toQuestionResponse` keeps off the wire. The blanked example reuses the FITB regex so the target word is removed from the visible context too — inspecting the API response can't reveal the answer from either field.

```json
{
  "audioUrl":       "https://example.com/ephemeral.mp3",
  "phonetic":       "/ɪˈfɛm(ə)rəl/",
  "definition":     "lasting a very short time",
  "blankedExample": "Her interest in chess proved ___ — within a month she'd moved on."
}
```

#### 4.4.1 Progressive Hints

The user can press a **hint** button to reveal letters of the answer one at a time, left-to-right. Hints aren't free — each press is recorded on `QuizAnswer.hintsUsed` and feeds the SRS rating model.

| Rule                 | Detail                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reveal direction** | Left-to-right, one letter per press                                                                                                                                          |
| **Hard cap**         | ⌈length / 2⌉ letters — the answer is never auto-completed; the user must produce at least half the spelling themselves                                                       |
| **Storage**          | `QuizAnswer.hintsUsed` (integer, defaults to 0)                                                                                                                              |
| **Telemetry**        | Each press emits its own event so we can analyse hint timing later (time-to-first-hint, gaps between hints). Only the count is stored on the answer row                      |
| **Grading**          | Hints don't affect `isCorrect` — a correct spelling is correct regardless. They only shift the inferred SRS quality                                                          |

The hint count combines with the correct/incorrect outcome to produce the SRS rating. The full table lives at [[SPACED_REPETITION#Assisted Production quizzes (Spelling, Fill-in-the-Blank)]] and is mirrored here for convenience:

| Outcome                                | SRS quality                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Correct, no hints                      | 4 Good                                                                                                       |
| Correct, no hints, slow (> 15s)        | 3 Hard *(time-downgrade rule shared with pure production)*                                                   |
| Correct, 1 hint                        | 3 Hard                                                                                                       |
| Correct, 2+ hints                      | 1 Again — heavy scaffolding indicates the word isn't actually retained, so treat it as relearning            |
| Close misspelling, no hints            | 3 Hard                                                                                                       |
| Wrong (any hint count)                 | 1 Again                                                                                                      |

> [!note] No upgrade from low hint count
> "Used zero hints" doesn't earn 5 Easy. Hint count can downgrade quality, never upgrade it — same shape as the existing time-threshold rule. Easy emerges over multiple successful reps via the SRS scheduler, not from a single answer.

> [!note] Why hints aren't free
> If pressing hint had no cost, every user would tap it on every question and the SRS would never see honest signal. Tying hint count to a downgraded quality preserves the rating-inference accuracy that [[SPACED_REPETITION#10. How Quiz Types Feed Into SRS — Rating Inference Model]] depends on.

### 4.5 Not Yet Implemented

`LISTENING` and `MATCHING` quiz types are listed in the enum but the dispatcher raises a 400 — they're Phase 3 follow-ups (issues TBD). Requesting them returns *"Quiz type X is not yet implemented."*

## 5. Distractor Selection

For MCQ and FITB, distractor *quality* is what makes the engine feel intelligent versus random. The live implementation is `LayeredDistractorService` (WP-282) — a three-layer chain that asks lexical-knowledge sources first and falls back to the user's own collection only when those run dry.

### 5.1 The Layered Chain

`LayeredDistractorService` walks three strategies in priority order, asking each for as many distractors as still need to be collected, and stops as soon as `count` unique options have been gathered:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Need N distractors] --> B[Layer 1: WordNet siblings]
    B -- got enough? --> Z[Done]
    B -- need more --> C[Layer 2: Roget clusters]
    C -- got enough? --> Z
    C -- need more --> D[Layer 3: In-collection ranking]
    D --> Z[Done]
```

| Layer | Source | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **WordNet sibling synsets** | Tight conceptual neighbours under a shared hypernym (`cat ↔ dog ↔ horse` are all mammals). Genuinely confusable, never synonymous. |
| 2 | **Roget's 1911 thematic clusters** | Loose thematic neighbours sharing a head category (`joy / delight / sorrow` all live under emotion-themed heads). Captures associations WordNet's IS-A hierarchy misses. |
| 3 | **In-collection quality-rule ranking** | The user's other collected words, ranked by POS / CEFR / length. Used as the final fallback when both lexical sources come up short. |

**Cross-cutting contracts**, applied at every layer:

- **Synonym hard exclusion.** Any candidate whose surface word appears in the target's cached `synonyms` list (from `DictionaryEntry.synonyms`, looked up case-insensitively) is dropped outright. A synonym would be a *legitimate alternative answer*, not a wrong one. Cache misses degrade to a no-op — the filter is best-effort, not load-bearing.
- **Cached definitions only.** Distractor option text comes from `dictionary_cache` (`DictionaryEntry.definitions`), never live API lookups. Candidates without a cached enrichable row are skipped at the layer level. The shipped option shape is `DistractorOption(word, definition)` — both fields non-null and non-blank by record-constructor invariant.
- **Dedup by lower-cased word.** The composite seeds its dedup set with the target word (defensive — layers also exclude it), then keeps only the first surviving occurrence of each word across layers. Earlier layer's `(word, definition)` pair wins on collisions.

> [!important] What this means for the personal-notebook contract
> The user is still **only quizzed on words they collected** — targets always come from `UserWord`. But the *distractor* pool is no longer drawn from the notebook in the common case; it's drawn from WordNet/Roget. The notebook stays theirs; the wrong answers just got smarter.

### 5.2 Layer 1 — WordNet Sibling Synsets

`WordNetSiblingDistractorService` pulls candidates from the lemmas of synsets that share a hypernym with the target's synset. The bundle is **Open English WordNet** (~20k lemma/POS pairs after filtering through `cefr/word-frequency.tsv`), preprocessed into a gzipped TSV and loaded at startup the same way `LeveledLexicon` is.

**Filters applied in order:**

| Filter | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Same POS as target** | Enforced at lookup time by `WordNetSiblings.siblingsOf(word, pos)`. |
| **Not the target itself** | Defensive — covers self-referential synsets. |
| **Not a synonym** | Cross-cutting rule from §5.1. |
| **CEFR within ±1 band** | Siblings further than one band away are dropped. CEFR resolved via `LeveledLexicon.classify` (same chain as enrichment). |
| **Cached definition exists** | Single batched `findAllById` against `DictionaryEntry`; siblings without an enrichable cached row are skipped. No live API lookups. |

**Definition picking** prefers a cached definition tagged with the target's POS, falling back to the first non-blank definition string when no POS-match exists.

**Falls through** when the WordNet bundle has no row for the target — small lemma coverage outside the most common ~20k forms is expected, especially for technical or modern vocabulary.

### 5.3 Layer 2 — Roget Thematic Clusters

`RogetsClusterDistractorService` pulls candidates from the words sharing a Roget's 1911 head category with the target. The bundle is **Project Gutenberg #10681** (Roget's Thesaurus, 1911 edition) — 822 thematic clusters, ~17.5k words after frequency filtering.

**Filters applied in order:**

| Filter | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Not the target itself** | Defensive. |
| **Not a synonym** | Cross-cutting rule from §5.1. |
| **Cached definition exists** | Single batched `findAllById` against `DictionaryEntry`. |
| **POS preference** (sort, not filter) | Same-POS cluster-mates rank ahead of mismatched POS. Roget's clusters are POS-agnostic, so mismatches still rank — just lower. Implemented as a stable sort on a POS-tier key (same shuffle-then-stable-sort pattern as Layer 3). |

**Falls through** when the target isn't in any cluster. The 1911 corpus skews toward older common vocabulary; modern technical terms won't hit. When this happens the chain falls through to Layer 3.

> [!note] Why two lexical sources, not one
> WordNet and Roget capture different kinds of "near":
>
> - **WordNet** is a strict IS-A hierarchy. Siblings share a parent — perfect for taxonomic distractors (`oak / elm / maple`), but blind to non-hierarchical associations.
> - **Roget** is thematic. Cluster-mates share a topic without being co-hyponyms (`anchor / harbor / voyage` all evoke sea travel even though they're not siblings under any single hypernym).
>
> Running them in series catches both shapes of plausibility.

### 5.4 Layer 3 — In-Collection Quality-Rule Ranking

`QualityRuleDistractorService` is the original Phase A strategy, now positioned as the final fallback. It picks distractors from the **user's own collected words** (`UserWord` rows) plus a small-collection cache supplement, ranked by three sort keys.

#### The Ranking Keys

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Candidates] --> B{Same POS<br/>as target?}
    B -- yes --> C[Tier 0]
    B -- no --> D[Tier 1]
    C --> E[Sort by CEFR distance]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Sort by length distance]
    F --> G[Top N]
```

| # | Signal | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Same part of speech** | Same-POS candidates always rank ahead of other-POS. Mismatch is only used as a last-resort fallback when the same-POS pool runs dry. |
| 2 | **CEFR distance** | Candidates at the target's CEFR band beat ±1 band, beat ±2, etc. Resolved via the same `LeveledLexicon.classify` chain used by enrichment, so what the user sees as "level" matches what the engine reasons about. |
| 3 | **Length distance** (tiebreak) | Closer character-length wins. Stops "horse / fence / table" from sitting next to "kaleidoscopically". |

**What these signals mean:**

- **POS (part of speech)** — the word's grammatical category: *noun, verb, adjective, adverb*, etc.
    - **Source**: Free Dictionary API's `meanings[].partOfSpeech` field at enrichment time.
    - **Storage**: stored verbatim as a string on `UserWord.part_of_speech`.
    - **Multi-sense words** (e.g. "run" = verb + noun): only the *first* meaning's POS is persisted on the user's notebook entry. The full list is retained on the shared `DictionaryEntry` cache.
    - **Why it matters**: mixing POS across options turns a vocabulary question into a grammar question — the user picks the odd-class word without knowing the meaning.
- **CEFR level** — the Common European Framework reference band (A1 → C2) describing word difficulty.
    - **Source**: `LeveledLexicon.classify`, resolved from bundled wordlists.
    - **Why it matters**: distractors at the target's band force the user to discriminate on meaning, not on "that word looks too easy/hard."
- **Length** — literal character count of the word string (`word.length()`).
    - **Source**: computed on the fly, no storage.
    - **Why it matters**: closer-length distractors prevent the visual outlier giveaway where a uniquely long or short option stands out before the user has read it.

> [!note] Reference
> The "match POS, match difficulty, avoid length cues" rubric is standard practice in multiple-choice item construction. The guidance comes from:
>
> - Haladyna, *Developing and Validating Multiple-Choice Test Items* (3rd ed., Routledge, 2004)
> - Haladyna, Downing & Rodriguez, *A Review of Multiple-Choice Item-Writing Guidelines for Classroom Assessment* (Applied Measurement in Education, 2002)
>
> Both cover:
>
> - grammatical parallelism (the POS rule)
> - homogeneity of difficulty (the CEFR rule)
> - avoiding length as a discriminator (the length-distance rule)
>
> The CEFR-band metric is specific to this codebase; the rest of the rubric is decades-old psychometric guidance.

> [!note] Why stable-sort + pre-shuffle
> The flow:
>
> - Shuffle the candidate list with the supplied `Random`.
> - Stable-sort on the three ranking keys.
> - TimSort preserves order within equal-key groups, so the up-front shuffle becomes the random tiebreak *inside* each quality tier.
>
> The `Random` source decides the behaviour:
>
> - **Tests** → seeded `Random` → deterministic, reproducible question order.
> - **Production** → `ThreadLocalRandom` → varied across sessions.
>
> Layer 2 (Roget) uses the same pattern for its POS-tier sort.

#### Small-Collection Cache Supplement (WP-338)

When the user's in-collection pool is too small to yield three same-POS distractors, the service supplements from the **dictionary cache** — `DictionaryEntry` rows the user hasn't collected.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | In-collection ranked pool yields fewer than `DISTRACTOR_COUNT` after synonym filtering. |
| **Source** | `DictionaryEntry` where `isEnrichable = true`. |
| **Same-POS first** | Falls back to other POS only when the same-POS cache pool is also too small. |
| **CEFR proximity** | Same band → ±1 → ±2 (mirrors the in-collection ranking). |
| **Exclusions** | Words already in the user's collection (would otherwise be valid targets) and the target's synonyms. |
| **In-collection wins ties** | Cache hits land *behind* in-collection same-POS hits in the unified ranking. |

> [!important] Targets are always the user's own words
> The cache supplement augments only the **distractor** pool. Target words are still drawn exclusively from `UserWord`. Same contract applies to Layers 1 and 2 — only wrong answers come from outside the notebook.

#### Implementation note: decorate-sort-undecorate

The ranking keys are computed once per candidate and stashed on a `Ranked` wrapper before sorting (the **Schwartzian transform**), rather than recomputed inside every comparator call. The expensive key is **CEFR distance**, which calls `LeveledLexicon.classify` — at `n × log n` comparator calls per sort, doing the lookup inline scaled poorly. The wrapper pattern keeps lexicon hits at exactly `n` per call.

> [!warning] Known redundancy — scheduled for cleanup
> The CEFR lookup itself is *redundant*: `DictionaryEntry.cefr_level` already holds the value as a stored column (set during enrichment). The service re-derives it via `LeveledLexicon.classify` only because candidates arrive as `UserWord` objects, which don't carry CEFR.
>
> Once the joined-CEFR refactor lands, the wrapper's performance justification disappears (all three keys become cheap field reads) and this note can be deleted.

## 6. Storage Model

Each generated question is one `QuizQuestion` row:

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sessionId` | FK to the session |
| `userWordId` | The word this question is about — preserved even if the user later deletes the word |
| `quizType` | Enum: `MULTIPLE_CHOICE`, `FILL_IN_THE_BLANK`, `FLASHCARD`, `SPELLING` |
| `ordinal` | 0-indexed position within the session, used to render order |
| `questionData` | JSONB payload — type-specific shape (see §4) |
| `correctAnswer` | Canonical text for fast grading without re-parsing JSONB |

> [!info] Why both `correctAnswer` and `correctOptionId`?
> For MCQ and FITB, the correct answer can be referenced two ways: by **option id** (`"B"`) or by **canonical text** (`"lasting a very short time"`). The FE is free to send either form. Storing both means grading is O(1) without parsing the JSONB on the hot path.

## 7. Grading

`QuizSessionService.isCorrect(question, userResponse)` is intentionally minimal:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[userResponse] --> B{Null or<br/>blank?}
    B -- yes --> C[Wrong - skip]
    B -- no --> D{Quiz type<br/>uses option ids?}
    D -- yes --> E{Matches<br/>correctOptionId?}
    E -- yes --> F[Correct]
    E -- no --> G[Fall through<br/>to text match]
    D -- no --> G
    G --> H{equalsIgnoreCase<br/>correctAnswer?}
    H -- yes --> F
    H -- no --> I[Wrong]
```

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Null / blank input | Always wrong, recorded as a ==skip== |
| Whitespace handling | `trim` before comparison |
| Case sensitivity | `equalsIgnoreCase` for canonical text |
| Option id check | Only for `MULTIPLE_CHOICE` and `FILL_IN_THE_BLANK`; falls through to text match if absent |

> [!note] Why blank ≡ skip
> `isCorrect` returns false for blank input, and `countOutcomes` keys off `userResponse == null` to bucket skips. To keep "user submitted an empty box" and "user explicitly skipped" in the *same* bucket at storage time, blank strings are stored as null in `QuizAnswer.userResponse`. Otherwise the result row would split them into "incorrect" vs "skipped".

## 8. Result Computation

`finaliseResult` aggregates outcomes:

| Counter | How it's computed |
|---|---|
| `correctCount` | Answers where `isCorrect = true` |
| `incorrectCount` | Answers with non-null response and `isCorrect = false` |
| `skippedCount` | Explicit skips (null response) **plus** unanswered questions (`totalQuestions - answers.size()`) |
| `scorePercentage` | `correctCount / totalQuestions × 100`, two-decimal precision, half-up rounding |
| `averageResponseTimeMs` | Mean of non-null `responseTimeMs` across answers; null when no timed answers |

> [!warning] `responseTimeMs` is INTEGER, not BIGINT
> The DB column is INTEGER. The OpenAPI spec types it as `format: int64, minimum: 0`. The service rejects negatives as 400 and clamps the upper bound to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` so a malicious client can't trigger a `DataIntegrityViolation 500`.

## 9. Open Questions for Discussion

> [!question] Things worth deciding now or revisiting
> - Should `MultipleChoiceQuestionGenerator` allow the user to choose `WORD_TO_DEFINITION` vs `DEFINITION_TO_WORD`, or stay opinionated? (Currently hard-wired to W→D.)
> - Should FITB fall back to a **pre-blanked** sentence when the user's word has no cached examples? (Currently silent-skips.)
> - What's the right hint cap for spelling? Currently ⌈length / 2⌉, but a flat *"max 3 letters"* might feel more predictable. Worth A/B-testing once telemetry is in.

## 10. Deferred / Future Work

Things we've decided to defer rather than re-litigate. Each entry has a short rationale, the phase it's queued for, and any follow-up tickets where applicable.

> [!info] Phase 3 — Example-sentence content safety
> `DictionaryEntry.exampleSentences` flows from Free Dictionary into FITB, Spelling, and Flashcard payloads. Free Dictionary aggregates Wiktionary, whose sources include unmoderated Usenet/newsgroup citations — meaning cached examples can contain content unsuitable for under-18 users. Mitigation belongs at the **ingest pipeline** (source-citation blocklist, profanity wordlist, cache-purge backfill, optional LLM safety classifier), not the quiz engine — generators read the cache as-is and shouldn't make content-policy decisions. The companion Phase 4 effort to switch primary source to Cambridge (see next entry) sharply reduces the input rate of unsafe sentences from curation alone, but the filter remains required as defense-in-depth — even curated sources legitimately cover sensitive vocabulary. Tracked as a cross-cutting content-safety initiative outside this doc.

> [!info] Phase 4 — Cambridge primary + Free Dictionary fallback (multi-source dictionary)
> Today `dictionary_cache` is single-source (Free Dictionary, see `DictionaryEntry.SOURCE_FREE_DICTIONARY`). The redesign promotes **Cambridge** to primary — lexicographer-curated, ESL-tuned, with built-in CEFR tagging and a usable free tier (3,000 calls/mo, comfortable at indie scale given the existing cache-aside + negative-caching already short-circuit repeated lookups for the same word). Free Dictionary remains as a coverage fallback for words Cambridge doesn't have (slang, technical, regional, internet vocabulary). Schema work: composite `(word, source)` key on `dictionary_cache`, service-level aggregator with per-field source priority, two-pass async enrichment (Cambridge synchronous on word add; Free Dictionary async only when Cambridge returns 404 or null fields). Per-field priority chain: definitions / examples / phonetics → Cambridge first; CEFR level → Cambridge authoritative; audio URL → Free Dictionary primary until Cambridge audio support is verified; synonyms → Cambridge first, verify coverage. Tracked in [[PROJECT#Phase 4 — Vocabulary System: "Organized Learning"]].

> [!info] Phase 4 — Least-recently-quizzed candidate ordering
> Upgrade candidate ordering from random sampling (Phase 3 fix, [issue #335](https://github.com/AnunnakiCosmoCrew/WordPower-app/issues/335)) to *least-recently-quizzed first*. Requires a `UserWord.lastQuizzedAt` column updated each time a question is generated. The 500-cap then means *"the 500 most-overdue words"* — much closer to SRS semantics. Optionally fold in SRS-driven prioritisation (due-or-soon words first), which would merge the ad-hoc-quiz and review-queue flows where they overlap. Tracked in [[PROJECT#Phase 4 — Vocabulary System: "Organized Learning"]].

> [!info] Phase 4+ — Mixed quiz-type sessions
> The engine currently produces single-type sessions. A future enhancement would let one session mix question types — e.g. 3 MCQ + 3 flashcards + 3 spelling on the same word set. Two motivations: (1) variety on small collections (same words, six framings feels much fresher than the same words drilled MCQ × 6); (2) a richer practice mode in its own right. Implementation would extend `QuizSessionService.create` to accept a list of types or a "mixed" flag. Tracked in [[PROJECT#Phase 4 — Vocabulary System: "Organized Learning"]].

> [!info] Phase 4 — Definition-sense rotation in MCQ
> MCQ `WORD_TO_DEFINITION` currently always pairs each word with the same canonical definition, which lets a user memorise the (word, definition-string) pair as a string-to-string match without internalising the meaning — they may then fail to recognise the word in the wild when it appears with different phrasing (the *encoding-specificity* problem). Free Dictionary typically returns multiple senses per word; rotating which sense becomes the correct option across attempts forces semantic recognition rather than string-matching. Caveat: polysemous entries have *distinct* meanings per sense (*bank* the institution vs. *bank* of a river), so rotation needs a primary-sense filter — or restriction to senses sharing the target's part-of-speech — to avoid quizzing on a sense the user hasn't actually encountered. Distractors should be drawn from the matching-sense pool so stylistic register stays consistent across the four options. Tracked in [[PROJECT#Phase 4 — Vocabulary System: "Organized Learning"]].

> [!info] Phase 4 — FITB stem rotation
> FITB currently picks the *first* cached example sentence with a whole-word match (see [[#4.2 Fill in the Blank|§4.2]]), so a word always presents the same stem and the user can memorise the (stem-fragment, word) pair as a string match — same encoding-specificity problem as the MCQ entry above. `DictionaryEntry.exampleSentences` already stores multiple sentences per word, so the fix is a random pick from matching candidates per question rather than a schema change. Tracked in [[PROJECT#Phase 4 — Vocabulary System: "Organized Learning"]].

> [!info] Phase 4+ — LLM-inflected FITB option text
> FITB option text is currently **lemmas** ([[#4.2 Fill in the Blank|§4.2]]). Once the Phase 3 morphological-matching work ([issue #362](https://github.com/AnunnakiCosmoCrew/WordPower-app/issues/362)) lands inflected-form sentences in production, the user will sometimes see a slot like *"She wandered ___"* (blanking `ephemerally`) paired with options `[ephemeral, perpetual, ancient, thorough]` — the four lemmas cue meaning correctly but don't read naturally in an adverb slot. Inflecting all four options to match the slot (`[ephemerally, perpetually, anciently, thoroughly]`) is **UX polish, not a pedagogical change** — both shapes test recognition; the inflected version just reads more smoothly. The implementation path is an LLM call keyed by `(lemma, target_form)` with aggressive caching — single-word inflection is one of the most reliable LLM tasks, and `(lemma, form)` pairs are stable so the cache hit rate climbs fast. **Gated on two questions before pulling the trigger**: (1) does the app already have a server-side LLM call layer for other features? Adding one *just* for FITB option polish is a poor first reason. (2) once #362 ships, does telemetry show the lemma-only options actually hurt completion rates or generate user complaints? If neither gate flips, this stays deferred indefinitely. Tracked in [[PROJECT#Phase 4 — Vocabulary System: "Organized Learning"]].

> [!info] Phase 4 — Post-quiz discovery prompts
> After a quiz session, surface a soft prompt suggesting related words for the user to *opt into* adding (*"You're working on `transitory`. Words like `fleeting`, `ephemeral`, `momentary` might interest you — add to your notebook?"*). Critically, words only enter the candidate pool if the user explicitly taps to add — preserving the personal-notebook contract. Aligns with the existing Word Discovery deliverable in [[PROJECT#Phase 4 — Vocabulary System: "Organized Learning"]].

> [!info] Phase 4+ — Reduce capture friction for retention
> A user persistently stuck at a small notebook is an onboarding/UX failure, not a quiz-engine problem. Quick Capture, browser extension, share-sheet on iOS, OCR-from-screenshot — all the collection paths should make it trivial to keep the notebook growing. Quiz-side variety mechanisms (the layered chain in §5, the deferrals above) help around the edges, but the deeper fix is upstream. Tracked in [[PROJECT#Phase 4 — Vocabulary System: "Organized Learning"]].

> [!info] Phase 5+ — Sentence-audio dictation mode for spelling
> Synthesised audio of the example sentence ("hear the sentence, spell the word") is strictly better pedagogy than blanked text but is its own epic — TTS provider, caching, object-storage layout, offline pre-download, voice/accent UX, billing model. Revisit once v1 spelling completion-rate data is in. Originally noted under [issue #237](https://github.com/AnunnakiCosmoCrew/WordPower-app/issues/237).
